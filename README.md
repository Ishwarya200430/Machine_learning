## Machine Learning with Python: Diabetes Prediction

### Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project on diabetes prediction developed at Atharvo. The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics.

### Project Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **`models/`**: Saved model files after training.
- **`reports/`**: Project reports, including documentation and findings.

### Project Goals
- **Data Preparation**: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset for accurate predictions.
- **Model Development**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.
- **Deployment**: Implement the trained model into a practical application for diabetes prediction.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   
   ```
